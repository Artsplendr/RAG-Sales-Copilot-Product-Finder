# Sales Copilot - Multi-Market Sales & Product Finder (by using RAG with OpenAI)

## Project Goal

The goal of the Sales Copilot — Multi-Market Sales & Product Finder project is to provide a scalable, AI-powered tool that enables corporate sales teams to quickly identify the best matching products for international customers based on their technical requirements, budget constraints, and market availability. The system leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture that combines semantic search, keyword-based retrieval, reranking models, and an LLM to deliver precise, context-grounded answers. By processing heterogeneous data formats such as PDF specifications, Excel price lists, CSV inventory reports, and promotional catalogs, the Sales Copilot can unify knowledge from multiple sources and markets into a single intelligent search and answer interface. For this demonstration, all data used in the project was generated synthetically, simulating realistic product, pricing, inventory, and promotion datasets.

In practice, this solution aims to reduce the time spent on manual product lookup, improve sales accuracy, and ensure that recommendations are both technically valid and commercially relevant. Sales teams can query the system in natural language (e.g., “Find a silent HVAC unit for Germany with airflow above 700 m³/h and IP54 protection”), and the tool will retrieve relevant documents, rank them by relevance, and produce a clear, evidence-backed recommendation with price, availability, and promotion details for the specific market. By integrating reranking and LLM-based grounded answers, the Sales Copilot provides relevant results, enabling faster decision-making and improving customer satisfaction across international markets.
